# For benchmarking VQC performance vs classical ML models (Parallelized)

## Features:

- Benchmark different pennylane ansatzes and feature maps
- Track test and train accuracies
- Plot dataset accuracies across all ansatzes and fmaps
- Compare against Linear SVM and a simple Dense Neural Network
- Calculates resulting circuit gates
